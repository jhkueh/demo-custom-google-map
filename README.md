# Custom Styled Google Map

This is a custom styled Google Map ([web demo](http://jhkueh.github.io/demo-custom-google-map/)) built with:

+ Disabled default UI
+ Custom complex marker
+ Places search box
+ Custom control (Toggle Labels' Visibility)
+ [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/index.html) front-end framework

It was made to speed up my map-making process at Linkubi and with reference from the Google Maps JS API v3 docs [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/).
